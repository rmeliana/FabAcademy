I'm Eliana Rodrigues Martins , an electrical engineer, who is exploring the digital fabrication world. I'm Brazilian born in Sao Paulo, and a superfan of Japanese animation. My background \u00b6 Since my adolescence, I have been in the electricity field. I started taking toys and household appliance apart to know how they worked and sometimes I tried to fix them. I always followed my father on domestic repairs in our house. I took my first course in the area ( maintenance electrician ) when I was sixteen, in 2002, at Senai. With the experience, I wanted to learn more about other areas, such as: programming and mechanics of machining. I used to dream of developing a robot. Therefore, I invested two years of my life in a mechatronics technical course , which was a big challenge for me, because I wasn't good enough at Assembly language programming and used to fail in the machining. Even so, I stood out in my eletronic class and got a vacancy at Knowledge Olympics (state and national competition), as electronic assembler and programmer at the modality called Manufatura Integrada. In 2010, I began my degree course in Electrical Engineering , and at the same time, I worked as a designer at refractories civil area, modeling parts in AutoCad and Inventor softwares. I have gotten two internships: the first at an industry which manufactured agricultural machines and power generators, and the second at an electricity distribution company. Finally, in February 2017, I found my true passion, teach . I have worked for six months as teacher at a technical school, teaching disciplines of Math, Electronic, NR-10,Pneumatic, among other. It's incredible how knowledge and sharing information can change the students lives. Fab Lab Insper \u00b6 In August of 2017, I joined the technical team of Fab Lab Insper as a lab technician. Here, I introduce the digital fabrication to professors, students and the community. In classes, I help students develop their academic projects using the rapid-prototyping, with open source softwares and low cost materials. So, I teach them how to operate the machines and tools, and what methods are better to reach the goals. There is a day, called Open Day, when the team receive people from everywhere who want to develop and share ideas. On this day, the use of machines and environment is free for the community.","title":"About me"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"Hello folks!

Principles and Practices \u00b6 Assignment \u00b6 Plan and sketch a potential final project During this week I worked on defining my final project and started to create the documentation. The project idea came from the task of watering and putting my plants under sunlight. I love to take care of them, but sometimes I don't have enough time, specially when I'm traveling or so busy with work. Majority of my plants is rose bushes which need many hours of daylight according to this article . Therefore, I pass my days moving them to sunny places in my yard. So, why not to build a robot to do it for me? References \u00b6 In my research, I discovered some references to embase my project. The first one is called Hexa , a walking succulent plant robot. It can move the plant in and out of shade and stomps when it needs watering. However, its design is very sophisticated. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. The second is Elowan , a cybernetic lifeform. The project uses the plant signals to guide it toward light. PNR - Plant Nanny Robot \u00b6 I'm not an expert in drawing, but here's my project sketch: Description \u00b6 The Plant Nanny Robot (PNR) is a robotic mobile platform that takes care of a plant. People who need traveling for a short period (two weeks) or that don't have enough time to basic care of their plant, can use the PNR, ensuring the survival of their green loves. It moves itself forward or back toward light incidence, to keep the plant for longer under sunshine. It uses silver electrodes connected to the ground and plant stem for reading its signals. According to TED of Greg Gage in 2017 , plants can communicate through electrical signals that change with an external touch/motion, or also because of light as Elowan project . I took a look on the internet to find some silver electrodes, but apparently, we don't have them in Brazil. So, an option is to test the plant signals with a thin copper wire and Aloe Vera gel to ensure electrical conduction. Sunlight Sensor To avoid bumping into obstacles, and even into people or pets, there is an ultrasonic sensor that stops the robot's motions if necessary. Beyond sunbath, the PNR takes care of soil moisture. Through the handmade sensor that warns when watering is needed (turning on the water pump). Its mini reservoir has a level sensor of reed switch type that notifies the owner about the low water level (through an LED) and also blocks the watering system until refueling. To make the soil moisture sensor, I'll use two nails connected with a NPN transistor and LED circuit, as on the sketch below. When the ground is dry, the LED turns on. Soil Moisture Sensor I'll try to reproduce a reed switch sensor, and put it in a 3D printing or molded part with a magnet. Level Sensor In a little search on Thinginverse site I realize that is possible to built a water pump with a few parts. Water Pump All signals from sensors and commands will be processed by a microcontroller PCB.

Project Management \u00b6 Assignment \u00b6 Build a personal site describing you and your final project. Work through a git tutorial. What's Git and GitHub? How can I use them with MkDocs? \u00b6 And finally what is Markdown? I had a difficult time understanding the purpose of each one (Git, GitHub, MkDocs and Markdown) and how to use them together to create a site. Fortunately, in my work team, we were talking about interesting courses on Alura platform that we could take to improve our skills, and Git/GitHub course was one of them. I didn't conclude it, but it gave me a good knowledge about how Git and GitHub run. My second move was searching examples of Fab Academy websites and the Cheng Pan's documentation give me a clear ideia about the structure. Beyond it, my coworker Lu\u00eds Henrique Fonseca has already built a website called Robozito using MarkDown, MkDocs, Git and GitHub, so it helped me a lot. Research \u00b6 Git is an open-source version control system, in other words, free of charge. It's used for creating a history of changes in the source code of software's development projects. It was designed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system. Github is a remote repository created as an online Git repository hosting service. MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Markdown was created back in 2004 by John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) as an easy way for non-coders to write in a format that could be easily converted into HTML. John Gruber defines Markdown as, \u201cA text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)\u201c. Creating a personal site: Windows operating system \u00b6 Here the steps that I did to create my personal site: Install Python 3.8.9 ; Install Git and let the Git Bash terminal be started; In Git Bash terminal, type py --version to see if the process worked out; For downloading libraries from Git repositories, it's necessary the package manager of python, PIP. Type pip --version to see if it has already been installed; For starting the website follow Getting Started page of MkDocs. It'll create all the basics files of the site on the local computer and give instructions of how to make changes in each page; Changing the theme: my personal site uses a theme called Material for MkDocs that can be installed by the command pip install mkdocs-material on the computer system; In mkdocs.yml , change theme for material theme: name: material For hosting it on GitHub follow the Allythy tutorial from \"Deploy para o GitHub\" topic until the end. It'll also generated the URL of documentation, similar of mine https://rmeliana.github.io/FabAcademy/; Locally, on the computer, changes in the site can be seen by the command mkdocs serve and URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/.... However, once the files are on GitHub and it's made an update, a deployment process is needed in order to get updates published to GitHub Pages. For automating that, create a GitHub action following Parker Erickson tutorial ; Automatic GitHub deployment action Install all dependencies in order to deploy the updates. Create a file called requirements.txt on the root of the main folder on the local computer and copy the text below in it. Requirements text mkdocs>=1.1 Pygments>=2.4 markdown>=3.2 pymdown-extensions>=7.0 mkdocs-material-extensions>=1.0 Add the command pip install -r requirements.txt into main.yml (this file is in .github folder ): - name: Install dependencies run: | python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip install mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt Advice \u00b6 Mardown editor and Git IDE \u00b6 I've started using Notepad++ for changing the pages of my personal site. It's an easy-to-use software and has already been installed on Windows. Notepad++ Software For working with Git and its commands I used the Git Bash, including through it and the command mkdocs serve I could see the changes before push to online repository. Therefore, I needed to switch between the two software for adding or modifying some info. Reading the documentation of student Almir Kimura I discover another software that helps a lot with the process: Atom . With it, I can make adjust in my files, see a preview of Markdown and push updates to GitHub, everything on the same window. Below, the red square is the text editor, the green is the preview and the orange is the Git communication. Atom Software Image Alignment \u00b6 I followed the references of Material for MkDocs for learning how to align images, but I realized that the commands didn't work as I wanted. The images didn't center, I couldn't have a caption below them, and left and right alignments put the pictures side by side with the text. How I did to correct the commands Alignment Just switch the word center to left or right for making different alignments! <center> ![](imgs/requirements.jpg){style=\"height:300px\"} </center> or ![rose bushes](imgs/rose bushes.jpeg){.center style=\"height:240px\"} To use this last option, it's necessary to create a folder called stylesheet into the folder docs . Lastly, generate a file extra.css and copy the code below in it. .center { display: block; margin: 0 auto; } .left { float: left; } .right { float: right; } Image Caption <center> ![](imgs/help.jpg){style=\"height:400px\"} <figcaption><b>Help</b></figcaption> </center> Result: Help Display Videos \u00b6 Videos Youtube videos Go to the Video page on YouTube and click on the Share Button.

Computer Aided Design \u00b6 Assignment - Evaluate 2D and 3D software \u00b6 Model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project, compress your images and videos, and post it on your class page 2D software - Raster and Vector \u00b6 Research \u00b6 Source : Raster (or bitmap) images are described by an array or map of bits within a rectangular grid of pixels or dots. Vector images are described by lines, shapes, and other graphic image components stored in a format that incorporates geometric formulas for rendering the image elements. Raster At 100% the bitmap, or raster, version of the image looks almost the same as the vector version. Notice that as soon as the raster version is scaled, the pixels on the edge begin to show and the edges no longer look smooth. Vector The vector image is created by defining points and curves. (This vector image was created using Adobe Illustrator.) When vector graphics are scaled, the edges remain crisp and sharp no matter the size. Inkscape \u00b6 With this software it's possible to convert images into vectors, so we can use them in operations of CNC (.dxf), laser cutter (.dxf or .pdf) and vinyl plotter (.svg). How to raster an image: Choose a desired image and import it (shortcut Ctrl+i) in Inkscape. Click on right mouse button and select Rasterizar bitmap... . There're many ways to rasterize the image. I think the best way is choosing the option Colors , and type how many of them (im my case two). As a result, the preview is similar to the real image. Click and drag the image to the side. With the rasterized selected, go to tools bar Objeto > Preenchimento e Contorno . First, we need to remove the fill at tab Preencher (button sem cor ). And after stroke it at tab Cor do Contorno (button cor uniforme ). The result is below, and can be saved as DXF, SVG, PDF and others types files. Tab Preencher Tab Cor do Contorno Vectorized image Here you can download my Inkscape file (.svg). Gimp \u00b6 Gimp was used to edit all images of this website. This software allows you modify images: cut, remove background, add or highlight informative itens and more. Here a step by step how to remove a background of a photo: Open the image in Gimp. Select the tool Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Livre . The goal here is to contour the part of the image we'd like to leave at the board. The stroke is made point by point with the zoom support (Ctrl+Scroll mouse). Tool Free Selection 3D software \u00b6 In my professional life, I have already worked with some 3D software to model technical parts. Such as AutoCAD , Inventor and Fusion 360 , all products of Autodesk. In the last year, I discovered a new one, called Tinkercad for simple designs. I used it to make a tutorial for exchange students of Insper . So, the information below are parts of it. \u00b6 Tinkercad \u00b6 Tinkercad is a free online, easy-to-use app for 3D design, electronics, and coding too. The users can draw furniture, architectural scale models, assembling programmable electronic circuits, etc. It also has a Gallery, to see examples of projects visit the website . Interface \u00b6 This is the 3D project panel. Let\u2019s know about its tools: With one click, you can change the name of the project; This cube allows you to rotate de camera or view side. It\u2019ll help you to see all points of view in the project. Another way to do this is keeping the right mouse button pressed and drag the mouse; This menu allows you to control the camera.

Testing \u00b6 After knowing the tools, I decide to draw a Food Court. To demonstrate how I designed the tables here is the step-by-step video: Tinkercad 3D Model \u00b6 Here you can download the STL file . And you can access the Food Court in Tinkercad to use it. \u00b6 Fusion 360 \u00b6 I took a long time to design my final project because in each part I used to think about the processes of how to make it, what equipment or material I could choose or which one could be better. It was an exhausting assignment! Just a little tired kkkkkk I used a lot of commands to design the whole project. Here, I'll show some of them and give some tips too. With my sketch on hand, I started to design the main part of my project, the vase of plant. I looked for a little one that I have in my house and took its measurements. Thinking about the geometrical forms that make up the vase helped me to model it easier. First sketch \u00b6 I created a new sketch, and drew a circle with the dimension of the vase's base. I chose the plane XZ, but I realized that it'd be better if I had chosen the XY (the same orientation of CNC machines). It's a good idea to put the middle of the model at the origin coordinates (0,0)! I needed to model a cone with its top cut off, and the command Loft was perfect for that. To do this, were needed two profiles. One I already had (in the step above). The other, I generated on a new plane using the command Offset Plane . The command Offset Plane Two profiles on different planes The command Loft The result of the command Loft I followed the sequence above to design the entire vase, and used the command Shell to create a hollow cavity. The command Shell 3D Model Original Vase With the main part drawn I could make it as a reference for others parts. In this step, the plate was being built following the same angle of the body of vase. After, by the command Revolve The sketch of plate The command Revolve The result McMaster-Carr Component \u00b6 In the virtual PNR project, I used screws and nuts to fix its parts. It's not necessary to design them. Fusion has a 3D model library called McMaster-Carr Component, where we can seek to them. There, I pulled: screws M5x30mm, wing nuts and springs. McMaster-Carr Component Wing Nuts available The ones I pulled Another free 3D model library is the GrabCAD It's an online community where people share their projects. I accessed it a couple of times. The first, I was looking for a example of water pump. Changing Appearance \u00b6 In Fusion, it's possible to atributte characteristics of materials for the parts. Press the letter A on the board, we can active the command Appearance . There're many types of materials, as metal, plastic, wood, and even concrete. Here, I aplied the concrete material in the part called Plate. Tutorials \u00b6 Some bodies I didn't have idea how to model them, so I searched online tutorials. In this example below, I followed step by step to build a wheel. Tutorial My model Organization \u00b6 There are many parts to my project. Because of this the Fusion browser became extensive, and I had a hard time recognizing which part I was modifying. Browser of Autodesk Fusion To reduce that I started to design small assemblies as components and after introduce them in the main assembly file. With it is faster to recognize and modify each group.

Computer Controlled Cutting \u00b6 Group assignment \u00b6 characterize your lasercutter's focus, power, speed, rate, kerf, and joint clearance; document your work (individually or in group). All of the test files were created using Autodesk Fusion 360 by the lab technician Leonardo Naz\u00e1rio. And then, we made the conversion for .dxf files. Material \u00b6 For the tests, the MDF (Medium-density fibreboard) with a thickness of 3 mm was used. Sofware \u00b6 The laser cutter model is Duplotech 1080 and its software is called RDWorks (RDCAM) . It can support .dxf and . bitmap files. Here is its interface. Focus \u00b6 The laser cutter has a manual focus. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the distance between the material surface and the laser nozzle must be 6 mm. Therefore, we placed a 6 mm thick piece of acrylic on the MDF sheet and let the laser nozzle touches it (the two screws highlighted in the picture below can be handled to allow the cannon to be free/fixed). Setting test (power, speed, rate) \u00b6 To get a better sense of what the best parameters are for cutting and engraving we developed two tests, one of power(%) vs speed(mm/s) for testing cutting parameters and another one with interval(mm) vs power(%) using a fixed speed of 350mm/s to test engraving parameters. We set different parameters up divided by colors. You can download the setting test file here . The results after cutting and engraving in 3mm MDF Kerf Test \u00b6 In this file were drawn some 15 mm diameter circles. Each color was set up with a different power (%). And the first row was cut with a speed of 5 mm/s and the second 15 mm/s. You can download the kerf test file here . There isn\u2019t that much of a difference changing the parameters. The calculated kerf is around 0.225mm and 0.275mm . Joint clearance test \u00b6 Setting value: power 70%, speed 15mm/s. You can download the joint clearance test file here . The gap which had the best fit was 2.75mm (kerf around 0,25mm). Individual assignment \u00b6 Design, lasercut, and document a parametric press-fit construction kit, which can be assembled in multiple ways. Account for the lasercutter kerf; cut something on the vinylcutter. Parametric press-fit construction kit \u00b6 I started this assignment with high expectations and ideas. I decided to model and manufacture a dome. I saw some pictures of it on the internet and loved its structure. First attempt, I tried on my own to design the parts of it (triangles and connectors). In Fusion, I modeled each one and assembled them. I realized that it was super necessary has the full dimensions of the base and the layers. So, I couldn't close the geometry. Second attempt, there're many online calculators dome's structure such as: Simply differently , Geo Dome and Domerama . I couldn't work with them, because it's not clear the dimensions of each triangle and didn't have information about simple connectors (just bolts or dome hubs). So, I gave up of them. Third attempt, I found a Fusion tutorial for modeling the dome. I made some changes, like resize each part and create connectors to each layer. Here, I used the Change Parameters (based on MDF thickness and laser cutter kerf) for ensure that parts would fit together. The kerf was 0,25mm according to the test in session Kerf Test , and using a vernier caliper I measured the MDF thickness (3,1mm). Subtracting them, I had the right dimension to the joints. Assembly \u00b6 How to assemble the parts I started just cutting the four first parts (T1, T2, A and B) and assembled layer 1. Final Result \u00b6 Below there are some pictures of the dome assembled. It was a great assignment and finally, I understood about the kerf and how it influences the joints. Downloadable Files \u00b6 3D Model in Fusion DXF files and RDWors file : MDF thickness of 3,1 mm and kerf of 0,25 mm Vinyl Cutter \u00b6 To test the vinyl cutter, I used the vector file of Midoryia which was made at the CAD assignment with Inkscape. I decided to use heat transfer vinyl to stamp my lab coat (one more print ). The heat vinyl has a plastic protection that makes easier to transfer the print for clothing. When the sticker is printed, the plastic film has to be facing upwards. Therefore, the cut must be made by the side without protection. Plastic protection Using the Inkscape, I let just the vectorized image in the screen and after mirrored it. I just wanted to cut the character without the rectangle around it. For that, I selected the vectorized image and after actived the command \"Separar\". Seeing the pictures below, we can see that vectors are separated and I deleted the rectangle. I resized the picture for a height of 100 mm. Cutting the heat vinyl \u00b6 The vinyl cutter that we have at the lab is the Roland GX-24 (CAMM-1 SERVO). I placed the piece of material in the machine, set the parameters up and started the cut. It's time to take off the pieces that I don't need. And start using the tweezer for the little ones. At that point, I realized that these little pieces didn't cut right (I failed! ). So, I changed the force to 130gf and cut it again. Now it worked!!! Printing the heat vinyl \u00b6 I positioned my lab coat into the thermal press machine. I closed it and set the temperature to 180\u00b0C (it's important to let the clothing there being heated with the increasing temperature). Then, when it reached 180\u00b0C, I placed the Midoryia print, closed it again and set the time to 20 seconds.

Virtual Real 1,0mm 0,82mm 0,9mm 0,72mm 0,8mm 0,62mm 0,7mm 0,52mm 0,6mm 0,42mm 0,5mm 0,32mm 0,4mm 0,22mm 0,3mm 0,12mm Therefore, the minimum trace width that we were able to produce using the Roland MDX-540, depth cut of -0,14mm, is 0,12mm/4,72mils , when we use a virtual trace with 0,3mm. Files \u00b6 Eagle files; FlatCAM files; Gcodes files. Minimum isolation \u00b6 The minimum isolation hits on the same barrier as the trace width. If we get a cut depth deeper the tapered end-mill tool starts milling away the other traces during isolation milling. In the file below there are some traces near each other. We milled three PCBs with the same layout, but changing the depth cut. Files \u00b6 Eagle files; FlatCAM files; Gcodes files. Feeds & Speeds \u00b6 Here is the parameters that we used to mill our boards: Operation Tool Cut Z(mm) Multi-Depth(mm) Travel Z(mm) Feed Rate X-Y(mm/s) Feed Rate Z(mm/s) Spindle Speed(RPM) Drill 0.5mm-1.2mm -1.65 0.55 15 450 650 12000 Engrave 0,1mm\" 30\u00ba -0.11 0.06 450 650 12000 Profile 1/8\" -1.65 0.55 15 450 650 8000 Individual assignment \u00b6 Make an in-circuit programmer by milling and stuffing the PCB, test it, then optionally try other PCB fabrication process.

The goal here was to test the performance of Roland MDX-540 milling different traces width (range between 0.001 and 1.0 mm). To generate the gcode with its commands and parameters the software FlatCAM was used. In it, we can adjust depth cut, multi-depth, feed rate, spindle speed...
